<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to codePal, the first PAAS (pal as a service) company that has a wide variety of offerings- choose from our award-winning e-pets: cat's, dog's, and rabbit! 

Visit 


Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
